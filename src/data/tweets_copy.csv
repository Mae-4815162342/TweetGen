"Tune in as I deliver remarks from Buffalo, New York."
There are a whole range of issues that are susceptible if the leaked opinion on Roe v. Wade ends up being the actual Court opinion. It’s not just choice that’s at stake here.
Jill and I will travel to Buffalo on Tuesday to grieve with the community that lost ten lives in a senseless and horrific mass shooting.
"Jill and I pray for the victims, their families and devastated community from yesterday’s mass shooting in Buffalo, New York. Our hearts are heavy once again but our resolve must not waver; we must work together to address the hate that remains a stain on the soul of this nation."
You want to bring down inflation?Let’s make sure the wealthiest corporations pay their fair share.
"During my first year in office, American agriculture exports shattered all previous records—$177 billion last year alone.We have to keep investing in our farmers to reduce prices for consumers."
"I know families across the country are worried about the availability of infant formula. That’s why yesterday, I brought together manufacturers to discuss how we can increase supply as soon as possible."
Republicans in Congress are so deeply committed to protecting big corporations that they would rather raise taxes on working American families.
"Republicans love to attack me as a big spender. Let's compare the facts.Under my predecessor, the deficit exploded, rising every single year. Under my plan, we are on track to cut the federal deficit by $1.5 trillion by the end of the fiscal year."
Families across the country — especially those who need specialty formulas — depend on the availability of infant formula. I'm announcing new actions and working with the private sector to get infant formula into stores as quickly as possible without compromising safety.
"Senator Rick Scott’s ultra-MAGA agenda could raise taxes on 75 million American families, over 95% of whom make less than $100,000 a year. Their plan is going to make working families poorer."
"In remembrance of today’s tragic milestone, I’ve ordered the United States flag to be flown at half-staff in memory of the one million American lives lost to COVID-19."

"The Republican plan led by Senator Rick Scott of Florida would tax half of our small business owners an extra $1,200 a year on average."
"Through decades of organizing, negotiating, picketing, and protesting, labor unions secured vital workplace protections that union and non-union workers rely on today, and we are working to strengthen both unions and the workplace protections they provide."
Not only do Republicans oppose making big corporations pay their fair share—they want middle class families and small business owners to pay more in taxes.
"A stronger economy built from the bottom up and the middle out puts greater power in workers' hands to improve their lives, provide for their families, and choose higher quality, higher-paying, and safer jobs."
"Democrats are working tirelessly to open doors for more outstanding entrepreneurs.But the Republican plan led by Senator Rick Scott would tax half of our small business owners an extra $1,200 a year on average."
"American workers are beginning to rebuild our nation's roads, bridges, ports, and waterways.The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will create new jobs, modernize communities across the country, and open infrastructure jobs to people of all backgrounds."

"Judge Jackson’s confirmation was a historic moment for our nation. We’ve taken another step toward making our highest court reflect the diversity of America. She will be an incredible Justice, and I was honored to share this moment with her."
"Over the last four weeks, fewer Americans filed initial claims for unemployment insurance than any time in our nation’s recorded history. While we have more work to do to lower costs for families, today’s data demonstrates that America is on the move again."
"Today, we enshrine in law our recognition that the Postal Service is fundamental to our economy, to our democracy, to our health, and the very sense of who we are as a nation."
"If Republicans have their way, up to 100 million Americans with preexisting conditions could once again be denied health care coverage by their insurance companies.I’ve got a better idea. Instead of destroying the Affordable Care Act, let's keep building on it."
"Today, my Administration is extending the pause on federal student loan repayments through August 31st, 2022."
"Over 31 million people now have health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.4 out of 5 Americans can find quality coverage for under $10 a month.The average family is saving $2,400 a year on their premiums.The Affordable Care Act is stronger now than it has ever been."
"Mr. President, welcome back to the White House."
It’s an honor to welcome my friend President
back to the White House. I look forward to discussing the big step we’re announcing today that would expand coverage under the Affordable Care Act for families and lower health care costs for hardworking Americans.
To the Russian people: You are not our enemy. The American people stand with you and the brave citizens in Ukraine who want peace.
Putin has the gall to say he is “de-Nazifying” Ukraine.This lie isn’t just cynical. It is obscene. President Zelenskyy was democratically elected. He is Jewish — his father’s family was wiped out in the Nazi Holocaust.
"Watch live as I deliver remarks on the united efforts of the free world to support the people of Ukraine, hold Russia accountable for its brutal war, and defend a future that is rooted in democratic principles."
My message to the 82nd Airborne Division on the ground in Poland: Every single one of you stepped up. Thank you.
"Americans are getting back to work at a historic pace, with fewer Americans on unemployment insurance today than at any time in the last half century."
The United States is prepared to commit more than $1 billion in humanitarian assistance to help get relief to millions of Ukrainians affected by the war in Ukraine.
NATO has never been more united than it is today. Putin is getting exactly the opposite of what he intended to have as a consequence of going into Ukraine.
"This morning, we received news that the number of Americans on unemployment insurance fell to its lowest level since 1970.This historic progress is no accident: it’s the result of an economic strategy to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out."
"Today in Brussels I’m meeting with our NATO Allies, G7 members, and the European Council to discuss our ongoing response to Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine. We stand united in defense of democracy and with the people of Ukraine."
"The Affordable Care Act was groundbreaking and life-changing legislation that has provided access to health care to millions of Americans, including the more than 130 million Americans with preexisting conditions."
"The Affordable Care Act that was signed into law 12 years ago was the first step in ensuring that everyone has access to affordable health care. I am proud that since November 2021, 14.5 million Americans have signed up for quality, affordable coverage."
"Madeleine Albright was a force for goodness, grace, and decency — and for freedom. Hers were the hands that turned the tide of history. Jill and I will miss her dearly and send our love and prayers to her family."
"On the anniversary of the Affordable Care Act being signed into law, know that as long as any American lies awake at night wondering how they’re going to pay their medical bills, we will keep fighting to lower costs and further expand health coverage."
"We are stronger today than we were a year ago, thanks to the American Rescue Plan."
"We are pushing for investments so we can manufacture more in America, strengthen our supply chains, and move goods to market at lower costs.And I’m pressing Congress to pass my plan to lower the cost of essentials like prescription drugs and energy."
With all the bright spots in our economy—record job growth and higher wages—too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills. Inflation is robbing them of the gains they might otherwise feel.  I get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control.
"A large contributor to inflation this month was an increase in gas and energy prices as markets reacted to Putin’s aggressive actions. I know that higher prices impact a family’s budget, which is why I am fighting to bring down the everyday prices that are squeezing Americans."
Today’s inflation report is a reminder that Americans’ budgets are being stretched by price increases and families are starting to feel the impacts of Putin’s price hike. But I am fighting to bring down the everyday prices that are squeezing Americans.

"Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable."
The prayers of the world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces. President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering.

Donald Trump still doesn’t have a plan to get this virus under control. His failure to lead is costing American lives. Here’s what I’ll do as president:
"A good step forward. Yet President Trump continues to do everything he can to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.I will defend the rights of all Americans to have access to quality, affordable health care, free from discrimination."

President Trump asked to see the COVID death chart.
Every day it becomes clearer: We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Who we are. What we believe. Who we want to be. It’s all at stake.We have to vote Donald Trump out this November.
"Imagine the future we can create with Donald Trump out of the White House. A future where we:- Tackle the climate crisis- Build a new American economy- End our gun violence epidemic- Ensure our government works for all, not just the wealthy few"

We shouldn't have to beg this president to listen to the experts.
The hard truth is it didn't have to be this bad. But Donald Trump has squandered every chance he's had to contain the spread of this virus.
"BREAKING: Florida's coronavirus cases jump by 12,624, one of the state's highest daily totals. Florida currently has 47 hospitals with no available ICU beds and 25 hospitals with just one available ICU bed, officials say."
America can’t sit on the sidelines in the race for the future. My administration will invest $300 billion in research and development over four years to secure our global leadership and create millions of good-paying jobs.
Donald Trump needs to spend less time playing golf and more time listening to experts like Dr. Fauci.
"In January, I sounded the alarm regarding COVID-19. Over five months later, President Trump still hasn't taken the action needed to respond to the virus. It's unacceptable.This president has failed the American people every step of the way."
FLASHBACK by Joe Biden: Trump is worst possible leader to deal with coronavirus outbreak
Donald Trump has blithely tweeted that 'it will all work out well.' Yet the steps he's taken as president have only weakened our capacity to respond.
"The stakes couldn't be higher this November. Time and time again, Donald Trump has failed the people of Puerto Rico.As President, I'll spur economic development on the island and expand access to health care."
"Together, we're going to build a new American economy:"
The future must be made in America — by all of America. Here's how we'll do it:
", you want to talk about corruption? I’ve released 21 years of my tax returns — release yours or shut up."
Four years of Betsy DeVos is more than enough. We need a Secretary of Education who is actually a public school educator.

Increased testing isn’t the reason for the surge in coronavirus cases — Donald Trump's failed leadership is.
Case growth outpacing testing in coronavirus hotspots
The runaway growth in coronavirus cases isn't due to increased testing.
Trump launched his 2016 campaign by calling Mexicans rapists.He's spread racism against our Latino community ever since.We need to work in partnership with Mexico.We need to restore dignity and humanity to our immigration system.That's what I'll do as President.
Let me be clear: No one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a pandemic because they can’t pay rent.
Evictions are likely to skyrocket this summer as jobs remain scarce. Black renters will be hard hit.
"In more than half the country, local courts are reopening and beginning to process a backlog of eviction cases, sparking what economists and housing advocates say could be a historic surge in..."
"When there were 15 cases, the President said it wouldn't spread any farther. We just hit our 3 millionth case.We're paying for his failure."
Biden slams Trump's handling of COVID-19 crisis as US hits 3 million cases
Former vice president Joe Biden slammed President Trump's handling of the COVID-19 crisis and urged him to take action amid a surge in cases.
"— The courage you show every day is an inspiration to so many, and I'm grateful to have you by my side in this fight. We may not agree on everything, but this we do: Health care is a right — not a privilege. And we're going to make that a reality, together."
"is everything Trump is not. He has turned loss into purpose: the purpose of public service.Although he & I have different perspectives on the world, winning this election is essential.Then we can continue our struggles for justice with a compassionate president."
This is a national disgrace. We have to ensure these communities get the care they need immediately — and then tackle racial disparities in health care and our economy head-on.
"Black and Latino people in the U.S. are 3 times as likely to contract the coronavirus than their white neighbors — and nearly twice as likely to die, according to new data we obtained by suing the CDC"
"Donald Trump has called himself a ""cheerleader"" for the nation. But we don't need a cheerleader — we need a President. One who will:- Lead by example- Take responsibility- Tell the unvarnished truth- Listen to the experts and follow the science"
"Let me be clear: There’s no victory to be celebrated when we’re still down nearly 15 million jobs and the pandemic is getting worse, not better."
Biden challenges Trump's sunny picture of the U.S. economy as coronavirus cases surge
This is a job Donald Trump is entirely unfit for.
"“Mr. President, it's too much.”"
This is a shameful move. Now is the time for employers to have empathy for families juggling work and caregiving.It's long past time for President Trump to show some leadership so we can get this virus under control.
Florida State just barred many employees from caring for kids while working remotely. PARENTS ask: ‘What am I supposed to do?’

Tune in as I address the nation on the economic crisis and the latest jobs report:
"Mr. President, this pandemic isn't about you. It's about the health and well-being of the American people."
"If Donald Trump prevails in the U.S. Supreme Court, insurers could strip away your health insurance coverage or jack up premiums — simply because you experience long-term effects after battling the coronavirus.We can't let that happen."
Biden ties COVID-19 to Trump's 'callous' Obamacare assault: 'A new pre-existing condition'
"Biden's speech from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was his latest attack on Trump’s handling of the pandemic."
Equal representation and participation matter.
"The Democratic-controlled House approves a bill to make the District of Columbia the 51st state. The legislation now goes to the Republican-controlled Senate, where it faces insurmountable opposition."
"I know these times are dark, but I firmly believe that our best days still lie ahead. If we come together as one America, there's nothing that we can't accomplish."
Health care is a right for all — not a privilege for the few. We have to ensure every single American has access to the care they need and deserve.Here’s what I would do as president:
"Congratulations, Alexis. We need you in this fight. Proud to stand with you and Planned Parenthood Action Fund."
I am so proud and humbled to take on the role of permanent President and CEO of
Donald Trump is acting like a child who just can’t believe this pandemic has happened to him.
"Last week, President Trump claimed the virus would ""fade away.""Now, we're facing a record-high number of new cases, and it's surging across the country.Trump refuses to listen to the experts and take action — and we're all paying the price."
"In this moment, we have an enormous opportunity to root out systemic racism and close the racial wealth and income gaps. We can do it, together."
"I can't believe I have to say this, but we should be speeding up testing — not slowing it down."
"It’s in some of our darkest moments of despair that we’ve made some of our greatest progress. If we stand together, as one America, we'll rise stronger than before."
I've found that the way to overcome enormous tragedy in your life is to turn that grief and pain into purpose. Christian Cooper and I discussed how we can take our collective pain in this moment and turn it into a catalyst for change:
"This nation has always strived to serve as a beacon of hope, but Trump has made it clear that he does not believe our country should be a place of refuge. As president, I'll recommit to building a more inclusive and welcoming America."
My Statement on World Refugee Day
World Refugee Day is the time when all nations recognize the humanity and resilience of the millions of people forced from their homes by…
Folks credit me for speaking out on marriage equality in 2012 — but I'm not the one who took a real risk. Countless others did the hard work and paid a price just for being themselves. Christian Cooper and I discussed the trailblazers who came before us and the work that remains:
Donald Trump is so eager to get back to his campaign rallies that he’s willing to put people at risk and violate CDC guidelines — as long as they sign a waiver promising not to hold his campaign liable.Unbelievable.
The Tulsa Race Massacre is one of the worst incidents of racial violence in our history — and it has been erased from our national consciousness for far too long.It’s time we reckon with what happened in 1921.
I know it can be hard to keep faith that we will ever achieve that more perfect union we strive to be. But ours is a union worth fighting for — and we are all called to the cause.None of us can turn away. None of us can stay silent.
Donald Trump’s failure to fight the coronavirus with the same energy and focus that he uses to troll his enemies on Twitter has cost us lives — and is putting hope for an economic recovery at risk.
I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important — who we want to be. It’s all at stake.That's the case we're making in our first TV ad of the general election:
"On June 19, 1865, in Galveston, TX, the last enslaved African Americans were finally given notice of their freedom. 155 years later, we're still on the long road to equality, equity, and fairness for all.We can't rest until the promise of this nation is fulfilled."
"reminds us of how vulnerable our nation is to being poisoned by systems and acts of inhumanity—but it's also a reminder of our ability to change. Together, we can lay the roots of real and lasting justice, and become the extraordinary nation that was promised to all."
"Amy — from the moment you announced you were running for president in a snowstorm, it wasn't hard to see you had the grit and determination to do anything you set your mind to. You know how to get things done. With your help, we’re going to beat Donald Trump."
