317,Board salary will be 0 if my bid succeeds so that s 3M year saved right there
318,Since he is consistently wrong it should be possible to do quite well simply by doing the opposite of what he recommends
319,I feel it s important that one s hat also have a hat Long standing belief 
320,I used to be such a snappy dresser 
321,I think my clothes are too big for me
322,Thanks for teaching me so much about rocket engines 
323,My most immediate takeaway from this novella of a thread is that Twitter is way overdue for long form tweets 
324,Do you want Elon Musk to buy Twitter 
325,Exactly block size time should keep pace with the rest of the Internet
326,6 seconds better said as 6000 milliseconds which is a long time to computers is about right
327,If the current Twitter board takes actions contrary to shareholder interests they would be breaching their fiduciary duty The liability they would thereby assume would be titanic in scale 
328,Taking Twitter private at 54 20 should be up to shareholders not the board
329,Absolutely It would be utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote They own the company not the board of directors 
330,Interesting Just two questions if I may How much of Twitter does the Kingdom own directly indirectly What are the Kingdom s views on journalistic freedom of speech 
331,Will endeavor to keep as many shareholders in privatized Twitter as allowed by law
332,of Dragon and the Ax 1 astronauts approaching the orbiting laboratory before docking on Saturday April 9
333,How much do US Republican and US Democratic voters trust various media organizations The Republican skepticism regarding the Weather Channel is hard to stomach for a data guy like me

335,astronauts is holding 20 meters away from the station as the station crew works a video routing issue 
336,We have some cool ideas for sustainable lithium extraction refinement
337,Price of lithium has gone to insane levels Tesla might actually have to get into the mining refining directly at scale unless costs improve There is no shortage of the element itself as lithium is almost everywhere on Earth but pace of extraction refinement is slow 
338,I mean that s a lot of hamsters
339,This takes commerce to a whole new level 
340, s Dragon Endeavour a key step in our ongoing work to open opportunities for space travelers in low Earth orbit

346,Looking forward to working with Parag Twitter board to make significant improvements to Twitter in coming months 
347,Yeah single most annoying problem on twitter imo
348,That is harder than a boss battle in DS3 
349,I mean if the people vote overwhelmingly for something it is at least a data point 
350,First I ve learned of this Will be patched shortly 
351,Spain should build a massive solar array Could power all of Europe 
352,Raptor pump power is over 100MW per engine 33 engines means over 3GW Not even remotely possible for electric motors batteries to compete 
353,We aim for 30 GM or 10 profitability all costs included
354,George Lucas once told me that the only reason Star Wars got made is because the old studio heads died
355,Old people don t change their minds with rare exception they just die Without death there would not be change 
356,This was an exceptionally difficult quarter due to supply chain interruptions China zero Covid policy Outstanding work by Tesla team key suppliers saved the day 
357,Just show her this video explains everything

361,Targeting Friday April 1 for launch of our fourth dedicated smallsat rideshare mission teams are keeping an eye on weather as the latest forecast shows a 30 chance of favorable liftoff conditions
362,Yes but we take a very cautious approach to safety As we confirm functionality on Canadian roads the beta will expand 
363,You may be in an area that is at maximum capacity Did SpaceX not provide an unsubscribe warning 
364,Canada requires charging by the minute vs kWh We re working to get that changed 
365,Will find out Our aspiration is just to make a modest return vs the fully considered price of Supercharging 
366,Good point SpaceX Tesla would probably have died since both narrowly escaped bankruptcy in 2008 
367,Covid 19 is the virus of Theseus How many gene changes before it s not Covid 19 anymore I supposedly have it again sigh but almost no symptoms 
368,The Washington Post s current slogan is Democracy Dies in Darkness Catchy for sure but then what s up with the paywall for news 
369,Ah yes I see they decided to editorialize Here s what I actually said 
370,I usually drive an alpha build but switch to beta right before release so I know what Tesla owners are getting
371,TikTok feels like such an obvious AI attack that it s annoying I prefer to be attacked by AI with subtlety maybe a rose some candles wine Barry White witty banter that sort of thing 
372,Toronto streetcars are not yet handled well by FSD Btw 
373,Funny to think that sapphire is just corroded aluminum 
374,This is pretty good 10 12 will have major improvements for tricky unprotected lefts heavy traffic in general We re also making good progress with single stack 
375,Am giving serious thought to this
376,Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy What should be done 
377,Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle 
378,Most people think the fruit was named after the color fools 
379,The movie Gaslight has gaslit so many people it s insane

382,Twitter algorithm should be open source
383,The algorithm needs to be open source
384,I m worried about de facto bias in the Twitter algorithm having a major effect on public discourse How do we know what s really happening 
385,True And even a 10 reduction in g would make reaching orbit relatively easy 
386,First Starship orbital flight will be with Raptor 2 engines as they are much more capable reliable 230 ton or 500k lb thrust at sea level We ll have 39 flightworthy engines built by next month then another month to integrate so hopefully May for orbital flight test 
387,SpaceX default plan was 65 of global launch mass to orbit this year Incremental demand might take that to 70 so not a major change Those numbers don t count Starship Rough math is 16 tons 50 launches 800 tons Rest of world is 400 tons mostly China 
388,Makes a huge difference to capital efficiency to localize production within a continent
389,Excited to hand over the first production cars made by Giga Berlin Brandenburg tomorrow 
390,But reaching volume production with sustained positive cash flow was last achieved by an American car company Chrysler 100 years ago Ford Tesla are the only American car companies to avoid bankruptcy Even GM Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009 
391,Prototypes are easy production is hard Making an electric car was not the hard part of Tesla dozens of companies have done that 
392,Starship full stack propellant load testing at Starbase
393,Good point Politicians political parties should be supported on their merits not like they are one s favorite sports team 
394,With so many mainstream media companies saying
395,is crazy dangerous I watched some of his videos Ironically he seemed more balanced insightful than those condemning him The groupthink among major media companies is more troubling There should be more dissent 
396,FSD releasing to Canada next week
397,I have so much respect for the associates doing an honest day s work at Tesla or SpaceX building servicing cars rockets Starlinks batteries solar many other things
398,Working hard to make useful products services for your fellow humans is deeply morally good
399,True I do support the current thing haha 
400,They have no idea how hard FSD is Only path to success imo is hardcore real world AI software with dedicated NN inference acceleration ASICs in car multibillion dollar NN training supercluster and 10 billion miles of vehicle data Good luck 
401,Thank you for the offer but such excellent training would give me too much of an advantage If he is afraid to fight I will agree to use only my left hand and I am not even left handed Elona
402,Telegram post by Ramzan Kadyrov head of Chechen Republic 
403,As a general principle for those looking for advice from this thread it is generally better to own physical things like a home or stock in companies you think make good products than dollars when inflation is high I still own won t sell my Bitcoin Ethereum or Doge fwiw 
404,It is not entirely unpredictable that you would reach that conclusion
405,Commodity prices soar to highest level since 2008 over Russia supply fears
406,Raw materials costs on track to post biggest weekly rise since at least 1970
407,Tesla SpaceX are seeing significant recent inflation pressure in raw materials logistics
408,If this version performs well we can probably lower min safety score to 95
409,Vector lanes is a particularly significant architectural improvement to Tesla AI
410,What are your thoughts about probable inflation rate over next few years 
411,Always worth reading about the many civilizations that have risen and fallen lessons we should take to heart There is danger to a United Earth in that it may result in a collective fall or ossification of civilization 
412,The Story of Civilization especially books 2 11

417,What if one atom at a time in your body was switched out for another atom There would be you with all new atoms and another you with the original atoms Human of Theseus 
418,You re welcome We have also sent power adapters for car cigarette lighters solar battery packs and generators for places where electricity is not available 
419,Optimized fully reusable Starship is 150t to same reference orbit as Saturn V In expendable mode Starship payload would be 250t to 300t 
420,Also nuclear is vastly better for global warming than burning hydrocarbons for energy
421,For those who mistakenly think this is a radiation risk pick what you think is the worst location I will travel there eat locally grown food on TV I did this in Japan many years ago shortly after Fukushima Radiation risk is much much lower than most people believe 
422,Hopefully it is now extremely obvious that Europe should restart dormant nuclear power stations and increase power output of existing ones This is critical to national and international security 
423,Self driving car will amplify traffic to insane levels as you won t feel the pain of driving yourself
424,Defeating traffic is the ultimate boss battle Even the most powerful humans in the world cannot defeat traffic 
425,Polytopia is way better imo if you like strategy games
426,Chess is a simple game Understandable when all we had to play with were squirrels
427,Basic appliances should not connect to the Internet or have significant compute power or they will are have obviously be turned into an army of ddos puppets
428,Maybe Tesla should make an AI vision device that plugs into these legacy traffic lights It could just look at traffic automatically maximize throughput 
429,Beta 10 12 probably releases Tuesday in US and Friday in Canada
430,Terminator Resistance is a good game
431,Even some of the best AI software engineers in the world don t realize how advanced Tesla AI has become
432,We are almost at the point where interventions are so rare on city streets that we can turn our attention to applying the code to highways No point in doing so until passing that threshold 
433,Increased oil gas production in the short term is critical or people around the world will be placed under great duress This is not a question of money it is a question of having enough energy to power civilization 
434,This was our 9th Falcon 9 launch in the first 9 weeks of 2022
435,Yes provided no metal particles in paint
436,Place light camouflage over antenna to avoid visual detection
437,Turn on Starlink only when needed and place antenna away as far away from people as possible
438,Important warning Starlink is the only non Russian communications system still working in some parts of Ukraine so probability of being targeted is high Please use with caution 
439,In class action lawsuits the actual plaintiff is always the class action law firm They just find someone willing to serve as a puppet to represent the class 
440,Updating software to reduce peak power consumption so Starlink can be powered from car cigarette lighter Mobile roaming enabled so phased array antenna can maintain signal while on moving vehicle

459,Starlink is a little patchy to Tonga right now but will improve dramatically as laser inter satellite links activate
460,Watch Falcon 9 launch 50 Starlink satellites to orbit 
461,LIDAR is a seductive local maximum SpaceX designed built them to dock with ISS However the road system was designed to work with biological neural nets eyes so a general solution to self driving necessarily will require silicon neural nets cameras Real world AI 
462,A general solution to self driving essentially real world AI requires writing extremely difficult software in the arenas of training inference control analytical tools data management hardware optimization simulation One of the hardest technology problems that exists 
463,Compilers can be way better too Not enough effort spent there 
464,We re working through the general case of making Steam games work on a Tesla vs specific titles Former is obviously where we should be long term 
465,Yes This is an advantage of iron cathode lithium batteries 
466,But 69 of statistics are false
467,Small changes usually affect production for less than an hour as they re applied to a few stations during breaks Big changes may impact output for a day or two Reversing out big changes or unexpected parts shortages are what impact several days 
468,Sometimes 20 small changes in a single week
469,Switching to renewables with batteries would avoid blackouts Batteries are essential due to the intermittent nature of renewables 
470,We must fight for it to be better
471,This is just peeling back the first layer of the corruption onion Stay tuned 
472,Watch Falcon 9 launch 46 Starlink satellites to orbit 
473,The only reason I didn t pay federal tax in 2018 is because I overpaid in 2017 Since they stole my tax records they actually know that

494,Most news outlets attempt to answer the question What are the worst things happening on Earth today It s a big planet Obviously some bad things are happening somewhere at any given time but focusing relentlessly on those does not give an accurate picture of reality 
495,So hard to find out what s going on in the world without being bombarded with news that makes one sad angry 
496,True careless negativity destruction is much harder than thoughtful positivity creation 
497,That s true to some degree but citizen podcasts that aren t negative like Rogan Fridman Dodd TED interviews etc are very popular Maybe part of why traditional media outlets are so negative is because old habits die hard They so rarely even try to be positive 
498,Why is the traditional media such a relentless hatestream Real question

529,It would appear that the so called fringe minority is actually the government
530,If Canadian government is suppressing peaceful protests that s where fascism lies cartoonist is just a shill
531,Now that the big automotive advertisers are making EVs you will see far fewer articles about EVs catching on fire It is not surprising that internal combustion engine cars have a tendency to combust externally too 
532, but the hearts of men are easily corrupted and the Ring of Power has a will of its own 
533,Honestly I would let the border regions vote Let the people there actually decide 
534,If you scare people enough they will demand removal of freedom This is the path to tyranny 
535,Seems odd that the UN still hasn t released 2020 world death rates
536,Freedom is being stripped away one piece at a time until it is gone
537,Manganese also requires less lithium as it operates at higher voltage
538,Just that manganese is an alternative to iron phosphorus for scaling cathode production to several TWh year

544,Starts with a TEnds with an AESL in the middle
545,They re being driven around in limousines so they can t grok it
546,Sounds about right for autonomous cars Optimus will greatly exceed this The economy will be as big as people want it to be There will be no scarcity except that which is artificially created 
547,This is a hard thing for us to do right now as we don t have enough satellites with laser links and there are already geo sats that serve the Tonga region That is why I m asking for clear confirmation 
548,Yeah this saves a whole tap Just swipe down for auto navigate 
549,Could people from Tonga let us know if it is important for SpaceX to send over Starlink terminals 
550,An SUV that is faster than a Formula 1 race car

557,For the sixth year in a row the number of U S births fell in 2020 reaching the lowest level since 1979 The fertility rate remains below replacement the level needed to compensate for deaths 
558,If there aren t enough people for Earth then there definitely won t be enough for Mars
559,UN projections are utter nonsense Just multiply last year s births by life expectancy Given downward trend in birth rate that is best case unless reversed 
560,We should be much more worried about population collapse
