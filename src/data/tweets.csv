We are close to the point where offering something for EU regulators to review makes sense
"Also, FSD Beta 10.12.2 now expanding to 100k cars. 10.13 smooths out intersection control, especially long lefts, and starts to handle roads with no map data at all. Last point is a big deal. Within a few months, FSD should be able to drive to a GPS point with zero map data."

"70 is currently the age when you receive maximum social security benefits. In other words, that’s when the govt concludes that you can’t hold a job!!"
"Open primaries sound like a good way to move candidates to be more centrist.Term limits help with the gerontocracy problem, but, frankly, there should be a max age beyond which you can’t run (maybe 70?), just like there are min ages for house, senate & president."
"Thanks, and also well done to you for advancing electric vehicles!"
"Once again, Bob nails it.Yes, I am endorsing a political candidate because he is competent!"
"It is rare for me to endorse political candidates. My political leanings are moderate, so neither fully Republican nor Democrat, which I am confident is the case for most Americans.Executive competence is super underrated in politics – we should care about that a lot more!"

And Palmer always forgets to mention that he never wrote a single line of Dogecoin code …
"For AI and most things, Python. JavaScript for web stuff. For high performance or tight code, C/C++, spiced up with some assembly."
"Maybe if they do the opposite, Twitter will be a much better experience – just an idea"
"My kids wrote better code when they were 12 than the nonsense script Jackson sent me. Like I said, if it’s so great, he should share it with the world and make everyone’s experience with Twitter better. If he does, you will see what I mean.Jackson Palmer is a tool."

"I support you, Bob! Some bots are good."
"Yeah, although I hesitate to admit that, because there are a lot of people that foam at the mouth if you even mention his name!"
The Democrat vs Republican tribalism among otherwise intelligent people is most distressing.Demonizing everyone who would vote for an alternate party is not constructive.
True. Tesla was attacked by Romney in 2 of 3 presidential debates. Those lines were fed to him by a particular individual in the oil & gas industry.The Dems turned negative over the past ~12 months. At least part of it is Mackenzie’s donation to PACs posing as charities.
I would be shocked if I’m *not* being spied on haha. My only ask is that anyone spying on me please not affect call quality too much or I can’t hear what’s being said!
I’m just talking about the mid-term elections in November. Not sure that there is a third party candidate.It’s rather hard to support a party when prominent members of that party keep attacking me and sidelining Tesla & SpaceX!
"Well, if you make something that looks like a meme & someone (not me) crops off your name, so it goes.Also, this is only a 6/10 meme, so maybe step down from that high horse!The selfless art of anonymous meme creators is something to be admired."
"Yeah, the public has no idea how much Tesla and SpaceX have been attacked/undermined, because we aren’t unionized (yet offer highest pay in industry!) and this administration would rather a company be dead than not unionized"
I couldn’t agree more! There is such a thing as too much sentience for household appliances.Imagine giving advanced AI to a toilet with an implicit “maximize
"” utility function, so it engages in deep societal manipulation just to get maximum"
"I support free speech, but not any one candidate. In fact, I gave money to & voted for Hillary & then voted for Biden.However, given unprovoked attacks by leading Democrats against me & a very cold shoulder to Tesla & SpaceX, I intend to vote Republican in November."

"Based on past experience, about 12 to 18 months. Companies that are inherently negative cash flow (ie value destroyers) need to die, so that they stop consuming resources."
"Yes, but this is actually a good thing. It has been raining money on fools for too long. Some bankruptcies need to happen.Also, all the Covid stay-at-home stuff has tricked people into thinking that you don’t actually need to work hard. Rude awakening inbound!"
"This would be a super bad idea, since stocks can swing wildly from one day to the next, eg Snapchat dropping 43%. Tesla is ~40% below ATH!However, eliminating estate tax dodges like GRATs would be good, since probability of kids being effective stewards of capital is lower."
"The degree to which the unions control the Dems is insane. It’s like watching a sock puppet “talk”, but the hand inside the sock is way too obvious!"

"They began brewing attacks of all kinds as soon as the Twitter acquisition was announced.In my 30 year career, including the entire MeToo era, there’s nothing to report, but, as soon as I say I intend to restore free speech to Twitter & vote Republican, suddenly there is …"
"Finally, we get to use Elongate as scandal name. It’s kinda perfect."
"If there’s ever a scandal about me, *please* call it Elongate"
"No, it was clear that their only goal was a hit price to interfere with the Twitter acquisition. The story was written before they even talked to me."
"Exactly. Moreover, the “friend” in question who gave the interview to BI, is a far left activist/actress in LA with a major political axe to grind."
"But I have a challenge to this liar who claims their friend saw me “exposed” – describe just one thing, anything at all (scars, tattoos, …) that isn’t known by the public. She won’t be able to do so, because it never happened."
"And, for the record, those wild accusations are utterly untrue"
The attacks against me should be viewed through a political lens – this is their standard (despicable) playbook – but nothing will deter me from fighting for a good future and your right to free speech
"To be clear, I’m spending <5% (but actually) of my time on the Twitter acquisition. It ain’t rocket science!Yesterday was Giga Texas, today is Starbase. Tesla is on my mind 24/7.So may seem like below, but not true."

Pretty much. The dirty tricks attacks will be next-level.
"I’m not surprised at all. That was to inoculate the public. As a prominent vaccine advocate, you should understand that.Yale is the epicenter of the woke mind virus attempting to destroy civilization."

"Exxon is rated top ten best in world for environment, social & governance (ESG) by S&P 500, while Tesla didn’t make the list!ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors."
ESG is an outrageous scam! Shame on
"Twitter claims that >95% of daily active users are real, unique humans. Does anyone have that experience?"
The audience laughter says it all
Seems like Twitter should welcome external validation if their claims are true
"20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher.My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.Yesterday, Twitter’s CEO publicly refused to show proof of <5%.This deal cannot move forward until he does."
"This transcription isn’t precise, but gets the gist of it"
So how do advertisers know what they’re getting for their money? This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter.

Whoever thought owning the libs would be cheap never tried to acquire a social media company!
The bots are angry at being counted
"Any sensible random sampling process is fine. If many people independently get similar results for % of fake/spam/duplicate accounts, that will be telling.I picked 100 as the sample size number, because that is what Twitter uses to calculate <5% fake/spam/duplicate."
I relied upon the accuracy of Twitter’s public filings
"If we collectively try to figure out the bot/duplicate user percentage, we can probably crowdsource a good answer"
"Ignore first 1000 followers, then pick every 10th. I’m open to better ideas."

In Defense of Elon Musk's Managerial Excellence
The Tesla CEO’s track record proves he’s a pre-eminent builder of businesses and maximizer of shareholder value.
"Board salary will be $0 if my bid succeeds, so that’s ~$3M/year saved right there"
"Since he is consistently wrong, it should be possible to do quite well simply by doing the opposite of what he recommends"
I feel it’s important that one’s hat also have a hat. Long-standing belief.
I used to be such a snappy dresser!
I think my clothes are too big for me
Thanks for teaching me so much about rocket engines!
My most immediate takeaway from this novella of a thread is that Twitter is *way* overdue for long form tweets!
Do you want Elon Musk to buy Twitter?
"Exactly, block size & time should keep pace with the rest of the Internet"
"6 seconds, better said as 6000 milliseconds, which is a long time to computers, is about right"
"If the current Twitter board takes actions contrary to shareholder interests, they would be breaching their fiduciary duty. The liability they would thereby assume would be titanic in scale."
"Taking Twitter private at $54.20 should be up to shareholders, not the board"
"Absolutely. It would be utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote. They own the company, not the board of directors."
"Interesting. Just two questions, if I may. How much of Twitter does the Kingdom own, directly & indirectly?What are the Kingdom’s views on journalistic freedom of speech?"
Will endeavor to keep as many shareholders in privatized Twitter as allowed by law
"of Dragon and the Ax-1 astronauts approaching the orbiting laboratory before docking on Saturday, April 9"

We have some cool ideas for sustainable lithium extraction & refinement
"Price of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining & refining directly at scale, unless costs improve.There is no shortage of the element itself, as lithium is almost everywhere on Earth, but pace of extraction/refinement is slow."
I mean … that’s a lot of hamsters
This takes commerce to a whole new level.

"Falcon 9 and Dragon vertical at 39A; targeting Friday, April 8 for launch of Ax-1 →"
Looking forward to working with Parag & Twitter board to make significant improvements to Twitter in coming months!
"Yeah, single most annoying problem on twitter imo"
That is harder than a boss battle in DS3!
"I mean, if the people vote overwhelmingly for something, it is at least *a* data point!"
First I’ve learned of this. Will be patched shortly.
Spain should build a massive solar array. Could power all of Europe.
"Raptor pump power is over 100MW per engine & 33 engines, means over 3GW. Not even remotely possible for electric motors & batteries to compete."
"We aim for 30% GM or ~10% profitability, all costs included"
George Lucas once told me that the only reason Star Wars got made is because the old studio heads died
"Old people don’t change their minds, with rare exception, they just die. Without death, there would not be change."
This was an *exceptionally* difficult quarter due to supply chain interruptions & China zero Covid policy.Outstanding work by Tesla team & key suppliers saved the day.

"Yes, but we take a very cautious approach to safety. As we confirm functionality on Canadian roads, the beta will expand."
You may be in an area that is at maximum capacity. Did SpaceX not provide an unsubscribe warning?
Canada requires charging by the minute vs kWh. We’re working to get that changed.
Will find out. Our aspiration is just to make a modest return vs the fully-considered price of Supercharging.
"Good point. SpaceX & Tesla would probably have died, since both narrowly escaped bankruptcy in 2008."

Am giving serious thought to this
"Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy. What should be done?"
Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy.Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?

I’m worried about de facto bias in “the Twitter algorithm” having a major effect on public discourse. How do we know what’s really happening?
True. And even a 10% reduction in g would make reaching orbit relatively easy.
"First Starship orbital flight will be with Raptor 2 engines, as they are much more capable & reliable. 230 ton or ~500k lb thrust at sea level.We’ll have 39 flightworthy engines built by next month, then another month to integrate, so hopefully May for orbital flight test."
"SpaceX default plan was ~65% of global launch mass to orbit this year. Incremental demand might take that to ~70%, so not a major change. Those numbers don’t count Starship.Rough math is ~16 tons * 50 launches = 800 tons. Rest of world is <400 tons (mostly China)."
Makes a huge difference to capital efficiency to localize production within a continent
Excited to hand over the first production cars made by Giga Berlin-Brandenburg tomorrow!
"But reaching volume production with sustained positive cash flow was last achieved by an American car company, Chrysler, ~100 years ago!Ford & Tesla are the only American car companies to avoid bankruptcy. Even GM & Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009."
"Prototypes are easy, production is hard. Making an electric car was not the hard part of Tesla – dozens of companies have done that."

"True, I do support the current thing haha!"

"You’re welcome. We have also sent power adapters for car cigarette lighters, solar/battery packs and generators for places where electricity is not available."
"Optimized, fully-reusable Starship is ~150t to same reference orbit as Saturn V. In expendable mode, Starship payload would be 250t to 300t."
Also nuclear is vastly better for global warming than burning hydrocarbons for energy
"For those who (mistakenly) think this is a radiation risk, pick what you think is the worst location. I will travel there & eat locally grown food on TV.I did this in Japan many years ago, shortly after Fukushima. Radiation risk is much, much lower than most people believe."
"Hopefully, it is now extremely obvious that Europe should restart dormant nuclear power stations and increase power output of existing ones. This is *critical* to national and international security."
"Self-driving car will amplify traffic to insane levels, as you won’t feel the pain of driving yourself"

"True, careless negativity (destruction) is much harder than thoughtful positivity (creation)"
"That’s true to some degree, but citizen podcasts that aren’t negative like Rogan, Fridman, Dodd, TED interviews, etc are very popular. Maybe part of why traditional media outlets are so negative is because old habits die hard? They so rarely even try to be positive."
